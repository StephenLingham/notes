# Leadership Manifesto

- A leader isn't a boss, a leader is a teacher and a mentor. Leaders add value by already knowing how to do something and showing other people how to do what they've already had experience with. It's not about being in control and commanding people, it's about adding value by distributing knowledge and leading the way. A leader knows the way, goes the way and shows the way.

- A leader shouldn't lead because they're feared, they should lead by the choice of the team. 

- A leader should delegate and trust. It's not possible to avoid mistakes, it's better that mistakes happen when the support is there rather than have them happen when someone is off on holiday. Let people do something they've never done before and support them rather than create single points of failure where only one person has knowledge because no one else was trusted to have the knowledge.

- A leader should care more about increasing the knowledge of the team rather than trying to make themselves indispensable by hoarding knowledge. 

- No matter who the leader is, there will always be something that the leader doesn't know that someone else does know. A leader should be humble and empower people who know more and utilise the people in the team. A good leader knows when to seek advice and ask for help.

- Treat your team like you treat your clients. No deadline is worth the mental wellbeing of the team. If you lose clients then you don't have a business, if you lose employees you also don't have a business. There's a big cost in losing domain knowledge and having to onboard new people. You also pay a recruiter fee and usually have to pay a higher market rate for new starts. Value the people you already have just as much as you would value a client.

- Being nice is worth a lot. A happy team is a productive team. Focus first on increasing the morale of the team, then the productivity and comradery will follow naturally. People will feel like they have purpose and want to put the effort in. Replace "crack-the-whip" culture with trust and autonomy.
