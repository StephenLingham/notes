## Quotes From Industry Leading Experts
Micro doesn't mean small

- "I called this onion architecture, as it had lots of layers and made me cry when we had to cut
through it." - **Sam Newman, Building Microservices** [1](https://book.northwind.ir/bookfiles/building-microservices/Building.Microservices.pdf)
- "Although “microservice” has become a popular name for this architectural style, its name does lead to an unfortunate focus on the size of service, and arguments about what constitutes “micro”. In our conversations with microservice practitioners, we see a range of sizes of services. The largest sizes reported follow Amazon's notion of the Two Pizza Team (i.e. the whole team can be fed by two pizzas), meaning no more than a dozen people." - **James Lewis and Martin Fowler** [1](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html)
- "It's worth noting that while "micro" is in the name, the size of a microservice isn't its defining characteristic. Rather, it's about having services with well-defined boundaries that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently." - **Milan Jovanovic** [1](https://www.milanjovanovic.tech/blog/understanding-microservices-core-concepts-and-benefits)
